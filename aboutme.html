            <p1> &emsp; Hello! I'm Megan McFarland, the proud founder of Tucson Math Co. Originally hailing from the beautiful city of Seattle, I made the decision to follow my passion for mathematics and moved to the vibrant desert community of Tucson after completing my studies. I'm a devoted advocate for the world of numbers, and my journey in mathematics began long ago when I was just learning my times tables. Over the years, this passion has grown and evolved, ultimately leading me to pursue a degree in Applied Mathematics at UCLA. During my academic journey, I discovered a love for helping others understand and appreciate the beauty of math. This desire to share my passion led me to become a dedicated math tutor. I've been fortunate to work with students of all ages, from diverse backgrounds and abilities, helping them navigate the world of math with confidence and success.</p1>
